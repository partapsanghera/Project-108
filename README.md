In Class 108, we learnt about identifying patterns of the data and how the data is distributed.

In this project, we plotted a normal distribution curve to see amazon mobile brands average rating.

Steps we used:

1.) We got the data and stored it in the data.csv file.

2.) Using pandas we read the data.

3.) We then plotted the average rating plot using plotly.figure_factory module

4.) We passed the Avg Rating of the brands as the first parameter

5.) We also passed the second parameter as the name (Note : This parameter denotes the name of the bell-curve which we plotted)

6.) Lastly, we stored the output in variable and using show() method we plotted the graph
